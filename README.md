# hello-world
This is a place i will start all my github journey
My name is Godwin Abutu, i love to code. My programming journey started when i first make a blog site with a developer, his awesome work on the site made me to fall in love with web design. since then, i have been finding ways on how to build this dream of mine. By his grace i know am building it already. 
Thats all i can say right now.
Much love
